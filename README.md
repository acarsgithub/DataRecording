# Data Recording Progress

### Below is a step-by-step summary of all of the tasks that we achieved throughout the research process so far
### Pertinent github links and pieces of code that are critical to the progress of the team's research will be included as well

After realizing that we will be working with the Intel 435i depth-mapping camera to obtain RGB, depth mappings, and other useful functionalities for our Autonomous Visualization Research, we went ahead and downloaded the IntelRealSense SDK 2.0 application to have a user friendly interface of the recordings while gaining familiarity with how the camera worked and how the files were saved

The files are saved as ".bag" extensions - extensions that we were not familiar with at the time
